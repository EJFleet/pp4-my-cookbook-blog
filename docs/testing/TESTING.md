## Validation
---

### HTML Validation

For my HTML files, I have used [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

Due to the usage of Jinja syntax (e.g., `{% extends "base.html" %}` and `{{ form|crispy }}`) and authentication requirements, the following approach was used for validation:

1. Navigate to each individual page via the deployed Heroku app link.
2. Right-click the screen or use `CTRL+U` (`âŒ˜+U` on Mac) to "View page source."
3. Copy the complete HTML code and paste it into the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) option.
4. Fix any errors or warnings, revalidate, and record results.

### CSS Validation

The [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used for validation. External CSS from the Bootstrap CDN was excluded. Minor warnings were related to the use of CSS variables for colors and fonts.

## Wave Accessibility Evaluation
---

Using the WAVE Accessibility Tool, I identified minor issues related to color contrast and made changes accordingly.  All pages have no errors with the following exceptions:
- There are 4 consistent errors across the site due to the logos in the footer - the WAVE Tool registers them as being empty `<a>` tags. 
- The faded appearance of a pre-approved comment causes contrast issues.  I will explore other ways around this in future development.

## Bug Fixes
---

|Bug|Solution|Fixed?|
|-----|-----|-----|
|Placeholder images not showing in recipe list | Updated featured_image field in model to have a cloudinary url rather than using a static file. Used python shell to update recipes that were already in database. | Yes | 
|Second page of recipes not showing - I had managed to save a recipe without automatically creating a slug - I navigated off the page before saving it properly but it still saved as a draft. | Use the shell to identify and fix recipes missing slugs. Add safeguard in AddRecipe view to make sure slugs are always created. Add a check for a slug in the index.html template to prevent the page breaking if there is no slug| Yes |
|Recipe Detail not showing for draft recipes|Update recipe_detail view to include draft recipes if the logged-in user is the author|Yes|
|Current image file not displaying in edit_recipe.html|Render each form field separately rather than as one crispy form|Yes|
|Team page not showing - KeyError at /team/|Return default queryset for all Team Members and then split the queryset in get_context_data|Yes|
|Blank spaces in index.html (draft recipes)|Filter recipes in the backend rather than using css to hide them|Yes|
|Admin panel not displaying - slug:slug/ pattern was catching the /admin/ route when it was included at the project-level via path(' ',include('blog.urls'))|Updated app-level urls.py to make the patterns more specific, so they donâ€™t unintentionally catch /admin/ or other URLs - changed to /recipe/slug:slug/ which avoids clashing with /admin/|Yes|
