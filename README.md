# My Cookbook - Recipe Blog

## Intro

For my fourth portfolio project, I created a blog app to display recipes to a user. The user can log in and leave comments on each recipe and also view a page that displays the team members that work on the blog.

  - easily log out of my account so that I can keep my account secure.

  As a Site Admin I can:
  - delete a User's account so that I can remove any inappropriate accounts.

  As a Staff Member I can:
  - create recipes so that I can share them on the site.
  - save a recipe as a draft so that I can make changes later.
  - publish and unpublish recipes so that I can choose whether to share the recipe or not.
  - update/edit recipes so that I can revise the recipe.

  - click on a recipe so that I can read the full recipe.

  - search for recipe so that I can find the relevant recipe for my needs.


  #### Comment CRUD

  As a Site User I can:
  - view a list of approved comments by registered users so that I can see tips and opinions on each recipe.
  
  As a logged-in Site User I can:
  - leave comments on a recipe so that I can be involved in the conversation.
  - see a notification that my comment is waiting for approval so that I know it has been sent.
  - see my comment displayed just in my view before it has been approved so that I can make any necessary changes.
  - edit my own comments so that I can correct any mistakes.
  - delete my own comments so that I can decide whether I want them to be public any more or not.

  As a Site Admin I can:
  - decide whether to approve or delete a User's comment so that no inappropriate content is displayed on my website.


  #### Team Members

  As a Site Admin I can:
  - create a new Team Member so that I can add a new member of staff as the team grows.
  - edit a Team Member so that I can keep content relevant if someone's details change.
